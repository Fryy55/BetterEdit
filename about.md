The ultimate editor improvement mod. Adds a ton of <cp>utilities</c> and <cj>improvements</c> to the level editor, such as <cd>redesigned menus</c>, <cp>bug fixes</c>, <ca>keybinds</c>, and more!

## <cg>Features</c>

 * Better color selection menu
 * Better font selection menu
 * Better movement menu
 * View tab for quickly toggling on/off visuals
 * Scroll wheel improvements
 * Custom Grid sizes
 * Set offset for Group IDs in Next Free
 * Pinch to zoom on mobile
 * Custom UI scaling
 * Fully customizable editor keybinds
 * And lots, lots more!

## <ca>Restoring Old Backups</c>

Pre-2.206 versions of BetterEdit relied on the now-defunct BetterSave mod to create backups for levels. If you have backups from this time you'd like to restore, locate the old backups at `<GD Save Directory>/levels/<level-string-id>/backups`, and then move them to `<GD Save Directory>/betteredit-level-backups/<level-numeric-id>/backups`. The string ID (`<level-string-id>`) of a level is likely very close to its name except converted to kebab-case, and `<level-numeric-id>` can be seen in-game in the created levels list by enabling the `Show IDs in Search` option from the `Editor Level ID API` mod.

## <cy>Support</c>

BetterEdit is first and foremost <cy>a passion project</c>, but if you would like to support development, I have a Ko-fi!

Supporters used to get exclusive features, but those features have since been made free for everyone. Feel free to donate if you want to thank me for my work on BetterEdit and Geode, but be aware that it'll **not** come with any extra perks anymore!
