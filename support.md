
BetterEdit is first and foremost <cy>a passion project</c>, but if you would like to support development, I have a Ko-fi!

Supporters used to get exclusive features, but those features have since been made free for everyone. Feel free to donate if you want to thank me for my work on BetterEdit and Geode, but be aware that it'll **not** come with any extra perks anymore!

## <cy>Do not donate any money you need yourself</c>.

I don't want starving students to give me their last pennies! Take care of yourself first!
